Hello All

I have modified this file to test how git behaves.

1) Friends Forever: This story is about the friendship between a frog and a mouse and shows how your actions against others can backfire on yourself. This story will teach your child about the African saying “Don’t dig too deep a pit for your enemy, you may fall into it yourself”.

2) Lion And The Mouse – This story explains the proverb “Small acts of kindness will be rewarded greatly” and how anyone regardless of their size and appearance, can make a major impact in certain situations. This tale can teach your child to appreciate others and create a helping tendency in their minds.
